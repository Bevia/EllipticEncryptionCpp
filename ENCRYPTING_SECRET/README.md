## How to use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for encrypting messages

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) can be used for encryption, but ECC itself doesn’t directly encrypt or decrypt messages in the same way RSA does. Instead, ECC is typically used in key exchange protocols (such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)) or in digital signature schemes (like Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)).

However, ECC can be used in conjunction with symmetric encryption (like AES) to encrypt and decrypt messages. The common approach is:

	1.	Key Exchange (ECDH): Generate a shared secret between two parties using ECC.
	2.	Symmetric Encryption (AES): Use that shared secret to encrypt and decrypt a message using a symmetric encryption algorithm such as AES.

Steps to Encrypt and Decrypt a Message:

	1.	Generate the ECC public/private key pairs for both the sender and the receiver.
	2.	Compute a shared secret using the ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) key exchange protocol.
	3.	Derive a symmetric key from the shared secret.
	4.	Encrypt the message using a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES) with the derived key.
	5.	Decrypt the message using the same symmetric key on the receiver’s side.
